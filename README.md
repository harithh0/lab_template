<h1>JWipe - Disk Sanitization</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b>
- <b>Diskpart</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

Objective

[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
Skills Learned

[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

    Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
    Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
    Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
    Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
    Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

Tools Used

[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

    Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
    Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
    Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
